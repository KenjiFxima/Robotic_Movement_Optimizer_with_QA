# Robotic Movement Optimizer with QA
This code is being implemented for robotic movement optimization based on quantum annealing now.  
In the plan,comparison between QA(quantum annealing) and classical method "held-karp algorithm" is to be done.  
## To Do
Implementation of QA code
embed library have error for x[0][0] not found in key of embedding,which keys is type of int(x[0][0] is key of bqm).
