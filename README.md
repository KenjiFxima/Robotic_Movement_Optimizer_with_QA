# Robotic Movement Optimizer with QA
This code is being implemented for robotic movement optimization based on quantum annealing now.  
In the plan,comparison between QA(quantum annealing) and classical method "held-karp algorithm" is to be done.  
## To Do
Check validity of the code for QA with the code running simulated annealing.
