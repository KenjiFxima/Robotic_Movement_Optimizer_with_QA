# Robotic Movement Optimizer with QA
This code is written for robotic movement optimization(RMO) based on quantum annealing.  
Comparison between QA(quantum annealing) and classical method "held-karp algorithm"(Traveling Salesman Problem with BitDP ) is done.  
## To Do
Check validity of the code for QA with the code running simulated annealing.
